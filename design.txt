- F commands are installed as plain old extensions
    - benefits from Chrome's existing sandbox model for security
    - benefits from Chrome's existing mechanism for automatic extension updates
    - no additional storage requirements for F commands
    - when installed, register themselves as supplying F commands
        - can supply more than one F command in a single extension
        - REJECTED: F could instead scan the list of installed extensions
          and send a command to each to see if it "exports" F commands, but
          that seems noisy and messy
        - an extension registers itself with F by supplying
            - an optspec for command line parsing for each F command
            - the name of each F command
        - an extension listens for F requests (the parsed command line is
          passed in every case)
            - command
            - help content
            - dynamic previewing
    - no need to register with F when an F command extension is uninstalled
      or disabled, since F's management interface listens for extensions
      being uninstalled, disabled, or enabled and won't dispatch to F
      commands that are not active.
    - XXX: what about duplicate command names?
        - is user notified at registration time?
        - how does the user choose which to use?  Could set the omnibox
          results.
            - does the user assign a priority?  No, too manual.
            - does Factotum track which commands are used more frequently
              and populates the omnibox results with those ahead of others?

- F supports
    - listening for extensions being disabled/enabled to know when to
      enable/disable corresponding F commands
  
- F provides a management interface just for F commands
    - shows a list of commands and the extensions that supply them
    - supports enabling/disabling F commands
        - does not disable the extension, otherwise extensions that supply F
          commands as well as other functionality would have that other
          functionaly shut off also.
            - disabling the extension would also make it impossible to
              disable a subset of F commands supplied by an extension
        - is possible to enable an F command in a disabled extension by
          prompting to re-enable the extension.
    - shows their help content
