- allow for any JS (or CSS) to be loaded into the page (via
  chrome.tabs.executeScript or chrome.tabs.insertCSS).  Each Fcommand gets a
  new property that is an array of things to be injected into the page
  immediately before that command executes.
    - may need to guard against multiple inclusion.
    - actually, this same mechanism should probably be used to inject the
      Fcommand into the page so it can execute in that context once all the
      prerequisites were loaded.

- prior to each Fcommand's execution, load any requested additional
  functionality into the current page.

- provide a management interface on the options page just for F commands
    - shows a list of commands
    - support enabling/disabling F commands
    - support enable/disable of individual aliases for Fcommands???
        - useful if you have an Fcommand that supplies an alias you don't
          want because it's supplied by a different Fcommand
    - shows their help content
    - editing commands
    - exporting commands

- internal Fcommand 'help' should pull up the help content for the given
  Fcommand

- support commands from non-local sources
    - e.g. specifying a URL will pull the Fcommand from the URL and use it.
        - need to specify the data format.
    - can these be edited locally???

- support commands that aren't commands at all but are actually JS libs?
  Same for CSS?
    - this provides a mechanism to load common libs locally, rather
      than from an external source upon use.
    - these can be requested for load by an Fcommand; give them aliases?  No
      need: they can just be requested via URL, then cached.
    - cache them?  Then only refresh them whenever the Factotum extension is
      activated?  If so, then maybe it's not necessary to have commands that
      aren't commands--they can be demand-loaded via the above mechanism and
      since they're cached, subsequent loads will be fast.

- popup page could show the last N Fcommands and/or the most frequently used
  Fcommands

- description property should always be a string.  Need to provide some way
  of indicating it is actually JS.  Storing every property as a string (or
  at least, a non-function) will make persistence easier).

- since we are injecting the Fcommand into the current page as a content
  script, it means Fcommands won't work when run on chrome: URL pages.
  Workarounds:
    - open a new tab, then close it when the Fcommand is done.  This looks
      messy, but may be the cleanest and most stable approach.
    - run it in the context of the background page.  This could introduce
      instability if the Fcommand does anything except read data.
