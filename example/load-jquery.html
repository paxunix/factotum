  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <div class="indented pretty">
    jq, loadjq - load jQuery into the page's main frame
  </div>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <div class="indented pretty">
    jq [<span class="opt">--min</span>] [<span class="opt">--version</span> <span class="optarg">v</span>] [<span class="opt">--delay</span> <span class="optarg">[sec]</span>] [<span class="opt">--error</span> <span class="optarg">[msg]</span>]
  </div>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <div class="indented pretty">
    Loads jQuery into the page's main frame.  If <span class="opt">--version</span> is not given, loads 2.1.1.
    <p>
    With <span class="opt">--min</span>, the minified Javascript for the requested version will be loaded.
    <p>
    <span class="opt">--delay</span> <span class="optarg">[sec]</span> specifies the number of seconds to wait before loading jQuery into the page.  Default=5.
    <p>
    <span class="opt">--throw</span> <span class="optarg">msg</span> specifies an error message to throw before loading jQuery (intended for testing).
    <p>
    <span class="opt">--bgthrow</span> <span class="optarg">msg</span> specifies an error message to throw from the bg context (after loading jQuery) (intended for testing).
    <p>
    <span class="opt">--fail</span> <span class="optarg">msg</span> specifies an error message to pass to onFailure() (intended for testing)..

This block is the opts={} declaration for the options parser.  It must

Factotum.runCommand().
